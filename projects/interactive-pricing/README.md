## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS & BEM
- Plain JS
- Mobile-first workflow

I tried to follow the MVC approach and wrapped the state object in a proxy to automatically update the view whenever the state is updated. Another point is the slider drag & drop, also implemented for touch.
